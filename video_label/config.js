Tricks consist of intentional\nmotions made with the board that are not simply slowing down/stopping the\nboard or steering the board as it moves. Steering around obstacles or\nsteering a board off of a jump and landing on the ground are not\nconsidered tricks in and of themselves.  \n\nCommon tricks involve actions like sliding the board along the top of an\nobject (e.g. a swimming pool rim or railing), jumping from the ground or\nthe surface of water into the air, and spinning or flipping in the air.\n\nEvidential description:\n\n scene: outside, often in a skatepark\n\n objects/people: skateboard, snowboard, surfboard, ramps, rails, safety\n gear, crowds\n\n activities: standing, sitting or laying on the board; jumping with the\n board; flipping the board and landing on it; spinning the board; sliding\n the board across various objects.\n\n audio: sounds of board hitting surface during trick; crowd cheering\n</pre>"}, {"name": "Feeding an animal", "key": "E002", "description": "<pre>Event name: Feeding an animal\n\nDefinition: One or more people give food to an animal, which it eats.\n\nExplication: Feeding usually consists of deliberately offering food for\nconsumption. In this event the giving of food should appear to be\ndeliberate rather than accidental. For instance, a dog snatching food from\na baby's hand would not customarily be considered an example of the baby\nfeeding the dog.\n\nThe types of food given to an animal may vary widely, but man-made\nnon-organic objects (e.g. a shoe, piece of plastic, medicine) are not\nnormally considered food even when they are consumed; by this logic, a clip\ndepicting humans administering medicine to an animal should not be\nconsidered a positive instance of \"an animal is fed and eats\". If the\nnature of the item that is offered/consumed is impossible to determine, the\nevent can be assumed to be a positive instance as long as the animal eats\nthe item, and no person in the video tries to stop the animal from eating\nthe item.\n\nThe clip must contain evidence of the animal consuming the offered food in\norder to constitute a positive instance.\n\nEvidential description:\n\n scene: indoors or outdoors, often in a zoo or a kitchen\n\n objects/people: food, bucket, bowl, bottle, cage\n\n activities: holding food in front of animal, filling food container,\n holding bottle, eating\n\n audio: animal noises (meow, bark, moo); chewing sounds; human talking to\n animal; human laughing in response to animal\n</pre>"}, {"name": "Landing a fish", "key": "E003", "description": "<pre>Event name: Landing a fish\n\nDefinition: One or more people captures and removes a fish from a body of\nwater, usually with a fishing pole or net\n \nExplication: The goal of fishing is to land, or catch, a fish. There are\nthree primary types of fishing: commercial, recreational and artisinal. The\ntools and techniques involved can vary across and within types. Commercial\nfishing often involves large nets or traps, and a boat on the open water.\nRecreational fishing - fishing for sport or pleasure - is most often done\nwith a fishing rod or small net, either from a boat or from a pier or\nbeach.  Artisanal fishing tends to use more traditional, less technological\ntechniques.\n\nGenerally, landing a fish involves the permanent removal of the fish from\nthe body of water, but this is not always the case.  In catch-and-release\nfishing, a practice within recreational fishing, the fish is set free in\nthe water immediately after being landed.\n\nEvidential description:\n\n scene: on or at the shore of a body of water (river, lake, ocean), usually\n in a boat or on a dock\n\n objects/people: boat, fishing pole, tackle box, nets, pier, tackle\n\n activities: casting, lurching of pole, reeling in, removing fish from\n hook, putting fish in net/bucket\n\n audio: sounds from the pole being cast; sounds of water lapping against\n boat; boat motor; narration of process\n</pre>"}, {"name": "Wedding ceremony", "key": "E004", "description": "<pre>Event name: Wedding ceremony\n\nDefinition: Part or all of a ceremony in which two individuals are married\n\nExplication: A wedding is a ceremony in which two people enter into the\nsocial and/or religious relationship of marriage. In most cases the two\npeople being married (known as \"the couple\") consist of an adult man (the\ngroom) and an adult woman (the bride), but in some weddings the people\nbeing married may be younger, or may be of the same sex as one another.\n\nWedding traditions and customs vary widely across different countries,\nreligions, and social/ethnic groups, but wedding ceremonies usually involve\nthe couple; an officiant who conducts or leads the ceremony; and a\ngathering of people who witness the ceremony. Wedding ceremonies may also\ninvolve other participants who perform specialized functions during the\nceremony, for instance escorting the bride at the start of the\nceremony. \n\nMost wedding ceremonies include one or both members of the couple walking\nor being carried towards each other to a location in front of that\ngathering of people, where they will stand next to or facing each other for\nthe rest of the ceremony. Ceremonies often include an exchange of wedding\nvows, which are spoken promises between the couple. Parts of the ceremony\nmay be dictated by the officiant and repeated by the couple or by the\nwitnesses. Many ceremonies also include a ritual exchange of gifts between\nthe couple; in Western weddings this often consists of each member of the\ncouple placing a ring on the other person's finger. Special wedding\ngarments are often worn by the couple and other participants in the\nceremony. In Western-style weddings the costume often consists of a white\ndress for the bride and a black suit for the groom. Wedding ceremonies\noften begin and end with a procession of the participants, accompanied by\nmusic or singing.\n\nWeddings are usually followed by a celebration (party with eating,\ndrinking, music, and dancing) known as the wedding reception, which is not\nconsidered part of the wedding ceremony itself.\n\nEvidential description:\n\n scene: indoors (often in a house of worship or government building like a\n city hall), or outdoors (in a park/backyard), usually daytime\n\n objects/people: couple being wed, attendees, officiant, chairs, costumes\n (gowns, dresses, suits), flowers, decorations, altar or table\n\n activities: walking, holding hands, kissing, taking pictures, exchanging\n vows, speaking, hugging, crying, standing, sitting, breaking glass, taking\n communion, kneeling, clapping\n\n audio: words spoken during ceremony (e.g. vows being read); music before,\n during or after the ceremony (e.g. Wedding March); witnesses clapping\n</pre>"}, {"name": "Working on a woodworking project", "key": "E005", "description": "<pre>Event name: Working on a woodworking project\n\nDefinition: One or more people fashion an object out of wood\n\nExplication: Woodworking is a popular hobby that involves crafting an\nobject out of wood. Typical woodworking projects may range from creating\nlarge pieces of furniture to small decorative items or toys. The process\nfor making objects out of wood can include cutting wood into smaller pieces\nwith hand or machine tools, carving wood to shape it, sanding wood to\nsmooth it, gluing wood pieces together, drilling holes into wood, and\napplying decorative finishes to the completed object.\n\nWoodworking is distinguished from construction, which typically involves\ncreation of large, permanent structures such a houses, sheds or buildings,\nwhich may or may not be made of wood.\n\nEvidential description:\n\n scene: often indoors in a workshop, garage, artificial lighting,\n occasionally outdoors.\n\n objects/people: woodworking tools (automatic or non-automatic saws,\n sander, knife), paint, stains, sawhorses, toolbox, safety goggles\n\n activities: cutting and shaping wood, attaching pieces of wood together,\n smoothing/sanding wood\n\n audio: sounds from power tools; hand tools being used (hammer, saw, etc.);\n narration of the process\n</pre>"}, {"name": "Birthday party", "key": "E006", "description": "<pre>Event name: Birthday party\n\nDefinition: An individual celebrates a birthday with other people\n\nExplication: A birthday in this context is the anniversary of a person's\nbirth. Less commonly, the term \"birthday\" can be used to refer to the\nanniversary of an organization's establishment, but a celebration for an\norganization does not satisfy the event definition.  \n\nA birthday celebration is a gathering of people who have been invited by\nthe host or hosts to come to a set location (often a private home,\nsometimes a restaurant, bar, nightclub, park, or other public venue) to\nsocialize in honor of the person(s) whose birthday it is (the birthday\ncelebrant(s)).  \n\nBirthday parties, as with other parties/celebrations, will typically\nfeature an assortment of food and beverages. Birthday parties are often\naccompanied by colorful decorations, such as balloons and streamers, and\nsome people may wear cone-shaped \"birthday hats\". The decorations may\ninclude signs or banners displaying a message for the birthday\ncelebrant. Often, especially for children's parties, guests will bring\ncards and/or gifts wrapped in shiny/colorful paper or bags, which will be\nopened by the birthday celebrant(s), or by their parents/siblings if the\nbirthday celebrants are too young to open the gifts by themselves. A cake\n(or sometimes cupcake or other food item) with lit candles, called the\n\"birthday cake\", is often served. The song \"Happy Birthday to You\" may sung\nby the guests while the birthday cake with lit candles is carried to a\ntable or counter where the birthday celebrant(s) are seated. The birthday\ncelebrant(s) then blow out the candles, usually after the song is finished,\nand the guests then clap and cheer. Birthday parties may also involve games\nor other organized group activities.\n\nEvidential description:\n\n scene: indoors (a home, a restaurant) or outdoors (backyard, park); day or night\n\n objects/people: decorations (balloons, streamers, conical hats, etc),\n birthday cake (often with candles), birthday celebrant, guests, gifts\n\n activities: singing, blowing out candles on cake, playing games, eating,\n opening gifts\n\n audio: singing \"Happy Birthday to You\"; saying happy birthday; laughing;\n sounds of games being played \n</pre>"}, {"name": "Changing a vehicle tire", "key": "E007", "description": "<pre>Event name: Changing a vehicle tire\n\nDefinition: One or more people work to replace a tire on a vehicle\n\nExplication: A vehicle is any device, motorized or not, used to transport\npeople and/or other items. Tires are ring-shaped inflated objects, usually\nmade of rubber, that fit over the wheel of a vehicle. The process for\nreplacing a tire includes removing the existing tire and installing the new\ntire onto the wheel of the vehicle.  Tires typically are replaced because\nthey are damaged or worn down. If a tire is damaged and loses air pressure\nas a result, it is called a \"flat tire\". Generally the driver of the\nvehicle with a flat tire will stop the vehicle as soon as possible and\nreplace the affected tire with a temporary tire called a \"spare tire\",\nwhich may be stored elsewhere on/in the vehicle. In other cases, the tire\nmay be changed not by the vehicle operator, but by a professional (e.g. a\nmechanic) who may use dedicated tools and work in a repair shop or similar\nsetting.\n\nEvidential description:\n\n scene: garage, outdoors, street, parking lot\n\n objects/people: tire, lug wrench, hubcap, vehicle (car, bike, lawnmower,\n etc), tire jack\n\n activities: removing hubcap, turning lugwrench, unscrewing bolts, pulling\n rim out of tire\n\n audio: narration of the process; sounds of tools being used;\n street/traffic noise; background noises from repair shop\n</pre>"}, {"name": "Flash mob gathering", "key": "E008", "description": "<pre>Event name: Flash mob gathering\n\nDefinition: A coordinated large group of people assemble suddenly in a\npublic place, perform a predetermined act to a surprised public, then\ndisperse quickly\n\nExplication: A flash mob is a group of people in a public place surprising\nthe public by doing something unusual in a coordinated fashion. Flash mobs\nusually consist of people either suddenly starting to perform a coordinated\nactivity (e.g. dancing, freezing in place, pretending to fight each other,\nre-enacting a movie scene), or performing normal activities but with\ncoordinated appearance/clothing or holding a coordinated prop object.  In\ncoordinated activity flash mobs, participants (known as \"flashmobbers\")\nstart out by engaging in routine activities in a public place, and are\ninitially indistinguishable from people who are not part of the flash mob\n-- until they begin performing the pre-determined coordinated activity. A\nflash mob typically ends with all of the flash mobbers suddenly going back\nto normal activities at the same time. Often flash mobs begin with one or\ntwo people and then more and more flash mobbers join. Sometimes flash mobs\n(particularly ones where dancing is the activity) are accompanied by\nbackground music. A previously-designated sound such as a clock tower\nchiming, a whistle being blown, or music beginning/ending may be used to\nsignal the start or end of the flash mob. In some cases a clip may show the\nflash mob group assembling prior to the flash mob activity starting; this\nmay consist the flash mob leader/leaders speaking to the group using a\nmegaphone.\n\nEvidential description:\n\n scene: indoor our outdoor, public place\n\n objects/people: a very large group of people, typically no objects involved\n\n activities: a wide range of activities can be performed, including dancing\n or singing in unison, moving in a coordinated fashion, or simply milling around\n\n audio: background music; sound that designates start/end of the flash mob\n activity; leader speaking to group of assembled flash mobbers\n</pre>"}, {"name": "Getting a vehicle unstuck", "key": "E009", "description": "<pre>Event name: Getting a vehicle unstuck\n\nDefinition: One or more people work to free a motorized or unmotorized\nvehicle that is stuck.\n\nExplication: A stuck vehicle is one that either cannot move, or can only\nmove in a limited area (e.g. a parking space). Usually movement is\nrestricted either because the vehicle is located on/in a substance that\nprevents the wheels of the vehicle from having enough friction to propel\nthe vehicle forward (e.g. mud, mud covered in water, snow, etc.), or\nbecause the angle of the vehicle and/or surrounding obstacles prevent it\nfrom moving normally.  Getting a vehicle unstuck can be done by maneuvering\nthe vehicle itself or by using another device (another vehicle, an object,\netc.) with the intention of getting the vehicle to a location or angle\nwhere it can again move normally.\n\nEvidential description:\n\n scene: typically outdoors, day or night, any weather\n\n objects/people: vehicle (car, boat, bicycle, construction vehicle), person\n operating the vehicle, possibly other people assisting in or outside of\n the vehicle, possibly additional vehicle(s) assisting\n\n activities: steering, hitching, chaining, driving, sliding, skidding,\n pulling\n\n audio: vehicle tires spinning against surface; engine noise from vehicle;\n narration or commentary on process from participants\n</pre>"}, {"name": "Grooming an animal", "key": "E010", "description": "<pre>Event name: Grooming an animal\n\nDefinition: One or more people groom an animal\n\nExplication: Grooming refers to caring for the hygiene/cleanliness and\nappearance of the animal. A very common form of grooming is bathing the\nanimal, usually accomplished by either immersing the animal in water or\nspraying the animal with water, often followed by application of\nsoap/shampoo and then additional rinsing with water. Other grooming\nactivities include trimming of hair and nails, cleaning of teeth, eyes, and\nears, and brushing, combing, and styling the fur of the animal. Procedures\nperformed to address a medical ailment, such as application of topical\nointment to the skin, are not generally considered to be examples of\ngrooming.\n\nEvidential description:\n\n scene: outdoors, in a yard or corral, indoors in bathroom, grooming salon,\n exhibition center\n\n objects/people: sink, bathtub, hose, shower, soap, shampoo, scissors, clippers\n\n activities: spraying hose, putting animal on table, rinsing, blowdrying\n fur, cutting fur, clipping nails\n\n audio: human talking to the animal; animal noises (e.g. purring);\n narration of the process\n</pre>"}, {"name": "Making a sandwich", "key": "E011", "description": "<pre>Event name: Making a sandwich\n\nDefinition: Constructing an edible food item from ingredients, often\nincluding one or more slices of bread plus fillings\n\nExplication: Sandwiches are generally made by placing food items on top of\na piece of bread, roll or similar item, and placing another piece of bread\non top of the food items. Sandwiches with only one slice of bread are less\ncommon and are called \"open face sandwiches\". The food items inserted\nwithin the slices of bread are known as \"fillings\" and often include sliced\nmeat, vegetables (commonly used vegetables include lettuce, tomatoes,\nonions, bell peppers, bean sprouts, cucumbers, and olives), and sliced or\ngrated cheese. Often, a liquid or semi-liquid \"condiment\" or \"spread\" such\nas oil, mayonnaise, mustard, and/or flavored sauce, is drizzled onto the\nsandwich or spread with a knife on the bread or top of the sandwich\nfillers. The sandwich or bread used in the sandwich may also be heated in\nsome way by placing it in a toaster, oven, frying pan, countertop grilling\nmachine, microwave or grill. Sandwiches are a popular meal to make at home\nand are available for purchase in many cafes, convenience stores, and as\npart of the lunch menu at many restaurants.\n\nEvidential description:\n\n scene: indoors (kitchen or restaurant or cafeteria) or outdoors (a park or\n backyard)\n\n objects/people: bread of various types; fillings (meat, cheese,\n vegetables), condiments, knives, plates, other utensils\n\n activities: slicing, toasting bread, spreading condiments on bread,\n placing fillings on bread, cutting or dishing up fillings\n\n audio: noises from equipment hitting the work surface; narration of or\n commentary on the process; noises emanating from equipment (e.g. microwave\n or griddle)\n</pre>"}, {"name": "Parade", "key": "E012", "description": "<pre>Event name: Parade\n\nDefinition: A large group of people process for a celebration/commemoration\nof some event\n\nExplication: A parade is a group of people processing either in celebration\nor commemoration of some event. Parades typically involve one or more\ngroups of people proceeding down a route between two lines of\nspectators. Most often parades process down a street and the spectators are\nlined up on either side of the street. People in the parade may be driving\ncars, riding horses, and/or walking, dancing as a group in coordinated\nspecial dress or costumes, or riding on a parade float. Parade floats are\ndecorated platforms that sit on top of a vehicle or are pulled by a vehicle\nor by people as part the procession. Parades are generally accompanied by\nmusic and by cheering or clapping from the spectators. Military groups may\nparticipate in parades, but not all military demonstrations constitute a\nparade.\n\nEvidential description:\n\n scene: typically outdoors, any season, usually on a street\n\n objects/people: a very large group of people, with floats, costumes,\n props, vehicles, horses, megaphones\n\n activities: marching, walking, singing, dancing, clapping, yelling\n\n audio: music from bands; crowd cheering or clapping; announcers describing\n the goings-on; horns or other vehicle noises\n</pre>"}, {"name": "Parkour", "key": "E013", "description": "<pre>Event name: Parkour\n\nDefinition: A person travels by foot from one point to another while\nperforming various gymnastic maneuvers over/on/through pre-existing\nman-made obstacles, typically outdoors.\n\nExplication: In parkour a person travels by foot as quickly as possible\nfrom one point to another while performing various acrobatic maneuvers\n(e.g. flips, swinging body over an object) and climbing over/on/through\npre-existing obstacles such as trees, street lamps, fences, walls, children's\nplayground equipment. Parkour is typically performed outdoors and often in\nan obstacle-dense urban environment. Freerunning is a related sport in\nwhich people interact with pre-existing obstacles via acrobatic tricks. For\npurposes of this event kit, freerunning is considered to be a form of\nparkour. Though typically performed outdoors, parkour may be practiced or\ndemonstrated indoors, usually in a gym. Although acrobatic tricks occur in\nother sports/activities (skateboarding, cheerleading, gymnastics, dancing,\nsnowboarding, etc.), these sports are distinct from parkour. In parkour,\nthe acrobatic tricks are performed as part of the interaction with the\npre-existing obstacles and/or in order to enable the athlete to maintain as\nmuch efficient forward movement as possible.\n\nEvidential description:\n\n scene: usually outdoors in an urban setting\n\n objects/people: natural environment, stairways, buildings, rooftops,\n fire escapes, playground equipment\n\n activities: running, scaling walls, jumping over obstacles, rolling\n\n audio: sounds of human hitting the various obstacles (e.g. feet hitting a\n picnic table); background music; occasional crowd reactions\n</pre>"}, {"name": "Repairing an appliance", "key": "E014", "description": "<pre>Event name: Repairing an appliance\n\nDefinition: One or more people make repairs to a household appliance\n\nExplication: Appliances are machines that are used for functions related to\nthe maintenance or care of a home or office (e.g. cleaning,\ncooling/heating), or to assist people in performing a household task\n(e.g. cooking, washing).

Non-major household\nappliances are typically small appliances that perform a more specialized\ntask, and include: coffee makers, toasters, stand mixers, food\nprocessors. Repairs to these items may include removing and replacing a\npart, or adjusting a part without replacing it.\n\nSmall machines that are held and moved with the hand while operating them,\nsuch as hand mixers, hair dryers, or electric toothbrushes, may also be\nconsidered appliances. Large, permanently-installed machines that perform\nhousehold tasks (e.g. a garage door opener, a central heating/cooling unit)\nare also not usually classified as appliances. Finally, machines primarily\nused for entertainment rather than household tasks, such as televisions, CD\nand DVD players, cameras, clocks, video game consoles, home cinema systems,\ntelephones, answering machines, etc. are not generally considered\nappliances.\n\nEvidential description:\n\n scene: typically indoors, in a home (kitchen, garage, basement)\n\n objects/people: appliance (dishwasher, refrigerator, toaster oven, washing\n machine etc); tools, rags, machine parts\n\n activities: unscrewing/screwing parts, lifting machine parts, squatting\n down, bending over, holding objects\n\n audio: sounds of tools making contact with object being repaired; sounds\n from power tools; narration of the process; sounds emanating from the\n appliance itself (e.g. garbage disposal being operated)\n</pre>"}, {"name": "Working on a sewing project", "key": "E015", "description": "<pre>Event name: Working on a sewing project\n\nDefinition: One or more people work on constructing a garment or other\nobject from fabric, sewn by hand or by machine.\n\nExplication: Sewing consists of passing a needle attached to thread or\nother type of filament through the sewable material known as \"fabric\",\nwhich is typically a textile but may also include leather, plastic or other\nmaterials. Sewing may be performed by hand or with the aid of a motorized\nor non-motorized machine. Sewing may involve constructing, repairing, or\naltering a garment or other object by sewing pieces of material together;\nit may also consist of sewing objects (e.g buttons, decorative trim) onto\nthe material. Related activities involving needle and thread, known as\n\"needle crafts\" include knitting and embroidery but these are not generally\nconsidered sewing.\n\nEvidential description:\n\n scene: typically indoors, in a workroom or craft room\n\n objects/people: sewing machine, needles, threads, fabric, patterns,\n scissors, pins, tape measure, ironing board & iron\n\n activities: measuring, cutting, sewing, ripping, tracing, bending over, pressing\n\n audio: sounds of sewing machine being operated; sound of fabric ripping;\n narration of process\n</pre>"}], "classes_name": "Events", "instructions": "<pre>Select the most appropriate video event using the dropdown box for the selected video frames.
